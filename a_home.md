### **SHORT BIO**


I am now a postdoctoral research fellow at [Intelligent Media Computing Lab](https://vmcl.bnu.edu.cn/) 
at [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/).
I collaborate with Professor [Hua Huang](https://vmcl.bnu.edu.cn/group/teacher/teacher01.html), who lead the Intelligent Media Computing Lab.
I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/) (BIT),
 where I was advised by Professor [Wei Liang](https://liangwei-bit.github.io/web/) 
and Professor [Yunde Jia](http://iitlab.bit.edu.cn/mcislab/~jiayunde/).
I worked at [Media Computing and Intelligent Systems Lab](http://iitlab.bit.edu.cn/mcislab/).
I was a visiting researcher at the Design Computing and Extended Reality (DCXR) Group at [George Mason University](http://www.gmu.edu/),
and was advised by Professor [Lap-Fai(Craig) Yu](https://craigyuyu.github.io/home/).
